## Conclusions

This simulation successfully demonstrated the functionality of Snort as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in detecting brute force attacks. By generating and monitoring network traffic, the system effectively logged intrusion attempts, providing insights into attack patterns and behaviors.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Effective Detection**: Snort's configured rules accurately identified brute force attempts, as evidenced by the detailed logs.
2. **Customization**: Utilizing `local.rules` allowed for precise and tailored detection mechanisms, highlighting the importance of focused configuration in security systems.
3. **Actionable Insights**: The logs generated during the simulation contained crucial information, such as timestamps, source IPs, and attempted credentials, which are vital for forensic analysis and improving defense mechanisms.

### Next Steps:
To enhance the capabilities of this setup, the following steps are recommended:
1. **SIEM Integration**: Ingest Snort logs into a SIEM platform such as Microsoft Sentinel for centralized analysis, alerting, and enhanced visualization of security incidents.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Leverage the SIEM to set up automated alerts for brute force attempts and other identified threats, reducing response time.
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Use the SIEM's built-in machine learning and correlation rules to identify sophisticated attack patterns that may not be immediately evident in raw Snort logs.
4. **Visualization**: Create dashboards to display trends, geographic distributions of attack sources, and other key metrics for better situational awareness.

This integration will provide a more robust security monitoring solution, enabling proactive defense measures and a clearer understanding of potential threats.
