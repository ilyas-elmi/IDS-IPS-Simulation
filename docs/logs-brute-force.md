# Log Analysis for Brute Force Simulation

This document contains the logs generated by Snort during a **brute force attack simulation** targeting the SSH service. The purpose of this simulation was to evaluate Snort's ability to detect multiple failed login attempts.

# Hydra: Brute Force Attack Tool

Hydra is a powerful and versatile tool widely used for conducting brute force attacks. It is primarily employed to test the robustness of authentication systems across various services such as SSH, FTP, and HTTP.

## How Hydra Works

Hydra operates by systematically trying a list of passwords (from a wordlist or custom list) against a specific target service. For instance, when targeting an SSH server, Hydra repeatedly attempts to authenticate a user (e.g., `ec2-user`) by cycling through each password on the list. The success of this attack largely depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the wordlist, especially if the target uses weak or common passwords.

## Use Cases for Hydra

1. **Assessing Password Security**: Hydra helps identify systems vulnerable to brute force attacks by exposing weak or commonly used passwords.  
2. **Simulating Real-World Attacks**: Security teams use Hydra to emulate the behavior of an attacker attempting unauthorized access, providing critical insights into potential vulnerabilities.  
3. **Efficiency and Speed**: Hydra is capable of testing numerous combinations quickly, making it an effective tool for assessing authentication mechanisms.

### **Snort Console Output Logs**

The logs provided below demonstrate Snort's ability to detect and identify multiple failed SSH login attempts during the brute force attack simulation. Each log entry provides critical information about the events that Snort monitored, ensuring a clear understanding of the attack patterns. Here's what each component of the log entries represents:

- **Date and Time**: Indicates the exact moment when the suspicious activity was detected. This is crucial for correlating events with other system logs or identifying the timeline of an attack.
- **Priority Level**: Reflects the severity of the event as assessed by Snort. A higher priority often indicates a more critical threat, while lower priorities may represent informational or less severe events.
- **Source and Destination**: Shows the IP addresses and ports involved in the activity.
  - The **source IP address and port** represent the attacker attempting the brute force login.
  - The **destination IP address and port** point to the target machine and service under attack, in this case, the SSH service on port `22`.

This detailed log output validates that Snort is successfully monitoring and flagging suspicious activities, such as brute force attempts, which are essential for maintaining network security and detecting potential intrusions in real time.
